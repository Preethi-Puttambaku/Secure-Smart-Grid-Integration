# Secure-Smart-Grid-Integration
This Project developed a secure smart grid monitoring system using AES encryption and ECC digital signatures to protect data transmission. Integrated Isolation Forest for real-time 
anomaly detection and built a dynamic dashboard for visualizing power usage and system alerts.

## Objectives
- Develop a secure and intelligent monitoring system for smart grids using AES encryption and ECC digital signatures.
- Detect cyber threats and operational anomalies in real-time using AI-based techniques, specifically the Isolation Forest algorithm.
- Enhance data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during grid communication and monitoring.
- Real-time dashboard for visualizing power consumption, renewable energy status, and anomaly alerts to support efficient grid management.

## Implementation:
- Designed a multi-layered architecture including Smart Grid, Data Acquisition, Backend Processing, and Frontend Presentation layers.
- Implemented AES-256-CBC encryption and ECC digital signatures for secure and authenticated data transmission.
- Integrated the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect real-time anomalies in power usage and system behavior.
- Developed a responsive web-based dashboard using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for live monitoring and visualization of grid metrics.

## Performance Metrices 
- Detection Accuracy: Measure the systemâ€™s ability to correctly identify normal vs. anomalous grid behavior.
- Precision and Recall: Evaluate how effectively the AI model detects actual threats while minimizing false alerts.
- F1 Score: Provide a balance between precision and recall for consistent anomaly detection performance.
- Response Time: Measure how quickly the system can detect and respond to anomalies for real-time grid stability.
- Encryption Overhead: Assess the computational impact of AES and ECC on system performance.
- Model Robustness: Test the anomaly detection model with varied data inputs, including simulated cyberattacks.
- System Reliability: Use real-time logs and monitoring to evaluate the consistency and uptime of the dashboard and backend.
